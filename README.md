Information about current projects I am working on in my free time

1. Maximally Dynamic XML Upload 18.04.2019
1.1 Brainstorming
The Idea is to have a a general XML Upload routine which can read any XML file and display it's structure in a set of tables according to the structure provided in XML. I have had this idea after working on a project which needed an XML upload but time did not allow to test and play.  


2. LaTeX Template for Code Documentation 18.04.2019
I am fairly unhappy with the state of documentation I have seen so far and as most people, Microsoft Word and I have our differences. I am looking into creating a LaTeX Template which accounts for code syntax, structure and generally everything that is somehow connected to SAP. This project is of very low priority, therefore this will take some time.
